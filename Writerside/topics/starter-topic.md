Kurocado Studio’s Design System provides a unified set of reusable components, patterns, and
guidelines to ensure consistency and efficiency across both internal and client-facing web or mobile
applications. It covers visual design, component interactions, accessibility standards, and best
practices. This system allows product teams to launch new features and interfaces quickly—while
maintaining a polished, on-brand user experience.

## Objectives

- **Improve Visual Consistency** Ensure each product or feature across Kurocado Studio follows the
  same visual language, from typography and color palettes to interactive elements and layouts.
- **Accelerate UI/UX Development** Provide a library of ready-to-use React (or framework of choice)
  components that decrease development time and reduce the need for re-implementing standard UI
  elements.
- **Enhance Accessibility** Enforce accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1) through pre-configured
  component behaviors, ensuring compliance from the start.
- **Enable Customization for Clients** Offer an easy way for clients to fork and adapt the Design
  System to meet their specific branding or accessibility requirements (e.g.,
  `@OUR_ORG—CLIENT_NAME—DESIGN_SYSTEM` on NPM).

## Use Cases

1. **Internal Product Teams**

   - Quickly prototype, iterate, and deploy new user interfaces that share a consistent look and
     feel across the company’s portfolio.
   - Rely on a single source of truth for branding guidelines and functional components.

2. **External Collaborators**

   - Freelancers or external design agencies can adopt the same components, ensuring a cohesive user
     experience without duplicating UI efforts.
   - Align with established design and branding requirements through a self-documenting component
     library.

3. **Client-Facing Projects**
   - Clients can adopt Kurocado Studio’s Design System to maintain consistency with our best
     practices while customizing the aesthetic to fit their brand.
   - Potential for creating and publishing a forked version (e.g., `@CLIENT_ORG/design-system`) with
     minimal overhead.

## Scope & Constraints

### In Scope

- **Core UI Component Library**
  - Buttons, forms, navigation, layout grids, and other foundational elements.
- **Design Tokens and Theming**
  - Color palette, typography scales, spacing units, and iconography.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**
  - Code examples, live component previews, and step-by-step “how to integrate” guides.
- **Accessibility**
  - Built-in support for ARIA attributes, and other accessibility considerations.
- **Internationalization**
  - Built-in support for language toggling, and other i18n considerations.
- **Automated CI/CD Workflows**
  - Linting, testing, and publishing pipelines to ensure code quality and ease of updates.

### Out of Scope

- **Internationalization**
  - Discovery needed

### Constraints

- **Branding Adaptability vs. Consistency**
  - Must strike a balance between providing robust customization hooks and enforcing studio-wide
    standards.
- **Resource Allocation**
  - Limited design or dev resources may focus on the highest-priority components first.
- **Tooling Integration**
  - Must integrate seamlessly with established tools like Storybook, or GitHub Actions without
    causing friction in existing workflows.

## Success Criteria

1. **Design & Code Quality**

   - **UI Consistency** All applications or websites using the Design System maintain a unified look
     and feel.
   - **Accessibility Scores** Achieve and maintain at least AA compliance on critical UI components.

2. **Development Speed**

   - **Reduced Handovers** Minimize back-and-forth between design and dev teams by providing fully
     documented components.
   - **Onboarding Efficiency** New developers can integrate the Design System into a project (or
     begin prototyping) within 5 minutes.

3. **Adoption & Collaboration**
   - **Internal Uptake** All new Kurocado Studio projects begin with or migrate to the Design System
     components.
   - **Client Customization** Clients successfully publish and maintain their own variants (i.e.,
     `@OUR_ORG—CLIENT_NAME—DESIGN_SYSTEM` or `@CLIENT_ORG/design-system`).
